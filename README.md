#### Description:
#### The objective of the project is to fetch the details of a business from its GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number).


#### ____________________________________________
#### Libraries used:
```
import requests
import datetime as dt
from tabulate import tabulate
```

#### Use of requests library:
> The requests library is the de facto standard for making HTTP requests in Python. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a beautiful, simple API so that you can focus on interacting with services and consuming data in your application.
```
response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)
```

#### Use of datetime library:
> In this project it is used for formatting the date of registration field.
```
# formatting 2017-07-01 to Jul 01, 2017 using strftime('%b %d, %Y')
```
*[Line 17]*

#### Use of tabulate library:
> In this project it is used for formatting the output in a tabular form using "outline" format.
```
print(tabulate(mylist, tablefmt="outline"))
```
*[Line 127]*

#### ____________________________________________
#### API used:
(It is a freemium version, providing 35 requests per month for free)

#### Link: [GST Verification by RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/idfy-idfy-default/api/gst-verification)

#### ____________________________________________
#### Working:
> User is prompted for input as follows:
```
project/ $ python project.py
Enter the GSTIN :
```
After user inputs the GSTIN, the API is requested with POST request and the response is stored in a variable and then converted into json format.

> Received response formatted in JSON: (Some fields are represented in * for security purposes.)

#### The output formated using tabulate module:
```
print(tabulate(mylist, tablefmt="outline"))
```

#### Note:
1. Creation of account on RapidAPI is necessary for sending requests.
2. [API Key] is generated when signed up and is mandatory in the header field.
3. test_project.py file has been attached for executing tests on the functions:
```
trd_name()
nat_of_wok()
date()
```
4. If the length of GSTIN is either too long or too short, then the program will be terminated. Using:
```
sys.exit()
```
